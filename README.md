# Traffic Light Control System

## Overview
The Traffic Light Control System is designed to efficiently manage the flow of vehicles on two roads using an AI-based decision-making process. The system dynamically adjusts traffic signals based on real-time vehicle count on each road.

## Features
- **AI-Based Signal Control**: Determines which road gets the green light based on the number of cars waiting.
- **Dynamic Traffic Simulation**: Randomly simulates car arrivals and departures.
- **Efficient Traffic Flow**: The system ensures the road with higher congestion gets priority.

## Working Principle
1. The system continuously tracks the number of cars on two roads.
2. AI logic decides which road should receive the green light based on congestion.
3. Once a road gets the green light, cars start clearing from that road.
4. The process repeats, adjusting dynamically to traffic conditions.

## Usage
- Can be implemented in real-world traffic management systems.
- Useful for AI and ML-based traffic optimization studies.
- Provides insights into adaptive traffic control mechanisms.

## Future Enhancements
- Addition of emergency vehicle detection to prioritize certain vehicles.
- Integration with pedestrian crossings to allow safe passage.
- Expansion to handle multi-lane intersections with more complex AI logic.

This system demonstrates how AI can enhance urban traffic management for smoother and smarter transportation.
